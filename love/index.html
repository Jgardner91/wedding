                <p class="box"> Our story begins under the cloud of world destruction. It was August 5th 2020, earth, tilted and
				    still spinning on its axis was tender to the touch after 5 months of lockdown. We met on a popular dating
				    site called <b>Hinge</b>, after bonding over 90s R&B, hoping to eventually duet as Monica and Brandy sharing the stage to
				    <i>The Boy Is Mine,</i> we decided to meet up. Our first date, in my mind was magical. We walked around the UC Berkely campus getting to know
				    each other. At the end we got ice cream and I farted. It was the perfect start.</p>
